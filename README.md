# Plasma Keyboard

The plasma-keyboard is a virtual keyboard based on [Qt Virtual Keyboard](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtvirtualkeyboard-overview.html) designed to integrate in Plasma.

It wraps Qt Virtual Keyboard in a window, and uses the input-method-v1 Wayland protocol to communicate with the compositor to function as an input method.

## Build and install

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && make install
```

## Layouts

The keyboard layouts are located in the [src/layouts](/src/layouts) folder.

They are forked from Qt's [layouts](https://github.com/qt/qtvirtualkeyboard/tree/dev/src/layouts), with modifications that we want for Plasma. Please view the official [Qt documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtvirtualkeyboard-overview.html#adding-new-keyboard-layouts) for a guide on how to create and modify keyboard layouts.

To use Qt's built-in keyboard layouts rather than the ones we supply in `plasma-keyboard`, set `PLASMA_KEYBOARD_USE_QT_LAYOUTS=1` when starting KWin (or the login session).

## Troubleshooting

KWin by default only shows the keyboard when a text field is interacted with by touch. Set `KWIN_IM_SHOW_ALWAYS=1` when starting KWin (or the login session) in order to force the keyboard to always pop up.
